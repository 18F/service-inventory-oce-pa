# service-inventory-oce-pa
Path analysis to understand the ways to present GSA's inventory of services with the Office of Customer Experience. 

## Project Description

To support a GSA Agency Reform Plan (ARP) initiative, the Office of Customer Experience (OCE) has conducted a high-level inventory of existing GSA products and services. OCE now wants to investigate how a product and service catalog based on that inventory might improve both customers’ purchasing experience as well as GSA’s service delivery efficiency. The goal of this “catalog” is to better explain GSA’s services and products and connect customers to the right services, in a user centered way. OCE believes that GSA customers are interested in GSA’s products and services, but GSA’s current presentation of offerings results in customer confusion around which services and products fit their needs and how to best access them. 

OCE is engaging 18F to create a strategy and a roadmap for the potential catalog that ensures it supports GSA’s ARP.  This engagement will also serve as a foundation for ongoing work with Office of Strategic Communications (OSC) within GSA. OSC is looking at re-vamping GSA’s entire web presence and wants this work to inform the strategy.
